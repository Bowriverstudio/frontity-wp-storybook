# Structure

## storybook

Holds the configuration of the storybook.

I put this in the base in the project, so frontity doesn't include additional dependencies, also it allows me to have stories in the wordpress theme.

## frontity

frontity was created with

`npx frontity create frontity`

Added the files in "frontity/testingUtils" as helpers for Storybook.
Added all the mdx files.
Modified file src/mars-theme/components/link.js to demo the "Props"

http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/packages-mars-theme-components-link--link

I did not add any global styles to storybook which would help it render better.

## wp-theme

This is an empty wordpress theme, but typically any customizations or plugins I add here.

## scripts

I did not include it here, but I have a few helper scripts to deploy the wordpress theme or storybook to a staging server.

## Tailwind

To make this as simple as possible, I did not include tailwind but typically include it.

## Documentation

Project Documentation and notes go here.
I have a private package where I keep global documentation, and just add it to the storybook configuration

## stories

Default Sample storybook stories.
