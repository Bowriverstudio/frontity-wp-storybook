# Storybook

I find storybook works well with edge cases. Right now I'm doing a woocommerce site, and have a few mockups for the client to pick. Also with the designer I make a really long title, and longer / shorter descriptions to show them how it renders.

I have a pretty decent sample of storybook with my Formik components. I did not include it here, because it depends on tailwind and I wanted to make this as simple as possible.

## Issues

### Pagination Component

I get the error: Uncaught TypeError: state.source.get is not a function

These two lines fail in storybook. The workarounds I found are hacks and not real soutions.

```js
const { next, previous } = state.source.get(state.router.link);

// Pre-fetch the the next page if it hasn't been fetched yet.
useEffect(() => {
  if (next) actions.source.fetch(next);
}, []);
```

### Post

This is not working in storybook.

```js
const Html2React = libraries.html2react.Component;
```
